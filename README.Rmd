This is the README for the physical activities script in the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data. 

For this data analysis, a number of activities are performed on the datasets.

First, the files are read into R from the .txt format. 

Second, they are labeled according to the data labels found in the y labels. Additional columns are also added to account for the subject and the activities being performed. All of this data is then combined into one dataset.

The labels are then cleaned up to replace them with regular words as opposed to the raw data labels. 

A tidyset dataset is then produced at the end that reports the mean grouped around the subjects and activities performed.
